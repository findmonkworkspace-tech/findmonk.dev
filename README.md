## Stack

- Next.js 15 / App Router / TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 pipeline (`@tailwindcss/postcss`)
- `ui.shadcn.com` CLI with ready-made component folders under `src/components/ui`
- Custom registry aliases for [21st.dev](https://21st.dev) and [allshadcn.com](https://allshadcn.com) baked into `components.json`

## Install & Run

```bash
cd shadcn-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to confirm the starter page renders (it already uses the sample `Button` and `Alert` components that were generated).

## Using the shadcn CLI

The `shadcn` CLI is initialised (see `components.json`, `/src/components/ui`, and the design tokens in `src/app/globals.css`). You can immediately start pulling components from different registries:

### Official registry (default)

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add card
```

No prefix is required—the CLI talks to `ui.shadcn.com` automatically.

### 21st.dev registry

`components.json` declares an alias called `@21st-dev` that maps to [`https://21st.dev/api/r/shadcn/{name}`](https://21st.dev/api/r/shadcn/button).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @21st-dev/toggle
```

Update the URL inside `components.json` if you want to target a specific 21st.dev username or team catalogue.

### allshadcn.com registry

An alias named `@allshadcn` is pre-wired to `https://allshadcn.com/api/r/shadcn/{name}`. The public API currently requires an authenticated session, so you may need to swap the URL for the endpoint/token your account exposes. Once reachable, usage mirrors the 21st.dev example:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @allshadcn/some-component
```

If the request fails, double-check that the URL is correct (or replace it with your personal CDN/API endpoint).

### Notes on Tailwind v4

Tailwind’s new PostCSS plugin is already imported inside `src/app/globals.css`. Any tokens generated by shadcn land inside this file, so you do **not** need a traditional `tailwind.config.{js,ts}` for common component use-cases.

## Linting & formatting

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint runs with the default Next.js config; feel free to add additional plugins if your team needs stricter rules.

## Deployment

Everything is ready for `vercel deploy`/`next build`. Run `npm run build` locally before deploying to ensure the registry components you added compile cleanly.
